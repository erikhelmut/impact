- collect goal trajectory with umi gripper
- choose pd controller gains for position controller that follows this trajectory with +/- 1N accuracy
- maybe try using different p gains for opening and closing for different dynamics

Questions

- check if reliability settings make sense during inference -> seems like messages are getting dropped more than expected...
- how can we handle aruco light problems

- what example for first test of diffusion policy?
- how can i evaluate diffusion policy during training?
    - caputre some test trajectories and check mean difference of goal force?

- change camera resolution to more field of view
