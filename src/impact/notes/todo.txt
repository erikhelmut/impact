- collect goal trajectory with umi gripper
- choose pd controller gains for position controller that follows this trajectory with +/- 1N accuracy
- maybe try using different p gains for opening and closing for different dynamics

Questions
- how do i handle cases in data processing where the distance is not available during data collection?
- check if reliability settings make sense during inference -> seems like messages are getting dropped more than expected...
